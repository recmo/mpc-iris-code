    "Given a bitvector $\\vec b ∈ \\{\\F,\\T\\}^n$ of length $n$, we take the usual binary operations of *not* $¬$, *and* $∧$, *or* $∨$, *xor* $⊕$, and also $\\popcount$. We can embed this in a ring $R$ by representing $\\F,\\T$ as $0,1$ respectively and using the following operations on vectors $\\vec b ∈ R^n$:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Masked binary operations in rings\n",
    "\n",
    "A *masked bitvector* has three values $\\mathtt{b} ∈ \\{\\F, \\T, \\U\\}^n$ which should be interpreted as *false*, *true* and *unavailable* respectively. The operations are the same as for binary, except when one of the arguments is $\\U$, the result is always $\\U$. We take $\\popcount$ to count the number of $\\T$'s and introduce $\\mathtt{count}$ to count the number of available entries i.e. either $\\F$ or $\\T$ but not $\\U$.\n",
    "\n",

    "Note that squaring, $\\vec a^{⊙2}$, produces a regular $0,1$ bitvector that is $0$ whenever the value is $\\U$ and $1$ otherwise, i.e. it  allows us to extract the mask as a regular bitvector. Similarly $½ ⋅(\\vec a^{⊙2} + \\vec a)$ extracts the data bits: $1$ for $\\T$ and $0$ otherwise. The reverse mapping, converting data bits $\\vec b$ and mask bits $\\vec m$ to a masked bitvector is $\\vec m - 2⋅\\vec b⊙\\vec m$. If the data bits are known to be $\\F$ in the in the unavailable region, then it simplifies to $\\vec m - 2⋅\\vec b⊙\\vec m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this representation *and* and *or* have awkward fourth degree expressions, though they can be evaluated using only two multiplies. The expressions for *xor*, $\\count$ and $\\popcount$ are quite nice considering that they correctly account for masks. This makes it a suitable system for computing fractional hamming distances.\n",

    "Generalizing this, given a secret vector $\\vec a ∈ ℤ_{2^{16}}^n$ and a cleartext vector $\\vec b ∈ ℤ_{2^{16}}^n$ we can compute shares of the dot product $\\vec c = \\vec a ⋅ \\vec b$ as $c_i = \\sum_j a_{ij} \\cdot b_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these newly created shares are correlated with the input secret shares. To solve this, they need to be re-randomized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Re-randomizing\n",
    "\n",
    "To re-randomize results we construct secret shares of zero and add them to the result. One way to do this locally is for each party to have two random number generators, $r_0, …, r_{n-1}$ and some cyclic permutation $r_{σ(0)}, … r_{σ(n-1)}$. The a secret share $a_i$ is locally updated as:\n",
