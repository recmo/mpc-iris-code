# Implementation

Following the [protocol specification](./specification.md) the following needs to be computed:


## Implementing $ùîΩ_{2^{16} - 17}$



## Operating cost

### Benchmarks



## Future Optimizations

### Secret sharing scheme

We can further explore the design space of secret sharing schemes and look into Packed Secret Sharing (PSS) to allow more computation with the same number of shares.

**Note.** These changes are not backwards compatible and requires converting the existing shares. Migrating the database is easy enough (though might be computationally/bandwidth costly), but the generation of shares on Orbs/user devices also needs to be upgraded. And there is a transition period during which old-scheme queries need to be on-the-fly converted before querying the new database.

### MSB extraction

We can explore different methods to reveal the comparison result.

Given double randomness $[r]_{\mathsf{MPC}}, [r]_{\mathsf{FHE}}$ we can efficiently convert between the two and do part of the computation, such as MSB extraction in FHE.

### Matmul implementation

The critical operation of matrix multiplication (over a ring) can be optimized further. Any such improvement is backwards compatible.

**Note.** Fast matrix multiplication algorithms are mostly avoided because of numerically stability reasons, which does not matter when working in rings which are always exact.
